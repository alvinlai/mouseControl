openFrameworks app to simulate mouse events ---

currently only for OS X, uses cocoa to create quartz events 
from C++ lib (http://openframework.cc)

working:
- move mouse
- left button press/release
- left button drag

needs:
- mouse events when oF app is not in focus (move already does this)
- right button press/release
